there's also a `react-markdown` viewer for react?
[demo // react-markdown](https://remarkjs.github.io/react-markdown/)


Tailwind CSS Ui kits?
UI kits is exactly what I need
[tailwind component ui kits](https://stackdiary.com/tailwind-components-ui-kits/)
this is dope asf.

I also need to prepare a certain amount of fonts and colors before hand and hopefully make it look G.

also I need to prepare a pre-confgured web dev starter kit so that it all comes pre config, don't have to go and install all those shits all over again.


Font is [Inter Family Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter). Pretty Clean, Pretty Cool.

Montserrat
Helvetica

Just realized obsidian uses the inter font as well. crazy.

it is **NOT** recommended to run tailwind + bootstrap there will be class collisions.
