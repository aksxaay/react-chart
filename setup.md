this is where I'll explain the process:

### Setup

okay so copy pasting the `package.json` file straight up didn't work, 

```
npm ERR! notarget No matching version found for prop-types@>16.0.0.
npm ERR! notarget In most cases you or one of your dependencies are requesting
npm ERR! notarget a package version that doesn't exist.

npm ERR!     /home/axsae/.npm/_logs/2022-02-21T19_19_09_044Z-debug-0.log
```


trying `create-react-app` route and then maybe the default way.

`npx create-react-app react-chart-app` - lol somehow I have it globally installed but it doesn't show up what.

apparently that command is deprecated, hence this is the new one
`npx create-react-app react-chart-app`

wait this causin errors too? somehow there's a global installation ayo wth
